## Task
>Â Having an array of numbers create a histogram that counts the number of elements for each range group.

Current personal best: `1.1s` on paralel run

### Approach

First i wanted to create sequential histogram in bend. This was a good exercise to learn the language and get comfortable with it. I got 10s on sequential run (Seq) and 6.5 seconds on paralel run (Par). From what i have practiced, i have encountered much greater benefits from Par runs than x2 speed increase, so i knew there was a lot to improve.

I realized that just by splitting the set into 2, creating the histograms for both sets and combining the results back into one, i can cut the heavy histogram computation in half, and thats exactly what i got from my second test with 7.5s Seq and 3.2s Par. Seeing that if i split the set into 4 and doing the same things i can achieve 7.8s Seq and 2s Par, i went all the way to split it into microsets where each set is just one element and run that, but it turned out to be much worse. 40s Seq, 32s Par. Finally, i tried to see the benefits of splitting it into 8 and 64 subsets and i have noticed almost no benefits from going beyond 64 subsets. For 8 subsets i got 7.5s Seq, 1.5s Par and for 64 i got 7.5s Seq and 1.1s Par.

My next approach is to see what would happen if i go in a different direction. I tried splitting the set into microsets of 1 element each, which should be the best, but there is a lot of repeated and unnecessery work. For example a lot of 0 + 0 operations.
